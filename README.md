# Moodle-Plug-in

This is a currently ongoing year long project in which a group of 9 of us are creating a moodle plug-in that will be used by the University of gthe Witwatersrand.
Its a plug-in that allows the lecturer to create a test question of many data structures and algorithms.
We are starting with an AVL tree
AS we progress this repo will be updated.
